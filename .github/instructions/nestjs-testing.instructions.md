# Testing Rules

## Unit Tests (`*.spec.ts`)

- Use `Test.createTestingModule()` from `@nestjs/testing` to set up the test module
- Follow the naming pattern: `describe('ClassName')` with descriptive `it('should ...')` blocks
- Place unit tests next to the source file they test (e.g., `users.service.ts` -> `users.service.spec.ts`)


## Integration Tests (`*.integration.spec.ts`)

- Place integration tests next to the source file they test, same directory as unit tests
- Use a real database — connect to the Docker `db` service (env vars from `.env` are available inside the container)
- **Table cleanup:** `repository.delete({})` throws `Empty criteria(s) are not allowed`. Use `dataSource.query('DELETE FROM table_name')` or `repository.clear()` to wipe tables between tests

## E2E Tests (`*.e2e-spec.ts`)

- Place e2e tests in the `test/` directory
- Use `supertest` to make HTTP requests against the running app
- Test complete request/response cycles including status codes, response shape, and error cases
- Test authentication and authorization flows (valid token, invalid token, missing token)
- Use a real test database — do not mock the database layer in e2e tests
- **Reproduce `main.ts` global config manually:** `Test.createTestingModule()` does not execute `main.ts`. Global pipes, filters, and interceptors must be applied explicitly in `beforeAll`: `app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true }))`

## General

- Run only related tests during development; run the full suite before finishing
- All test commands run inside the container: `docker compose -f nestjs-project/compose.yaml exec nestjs-api npm test`

## Test Data

- Use factories or builders to create test data objects
- Avoid hardcoding values in tests; use variables or helper functions to generate test data
- Use realistic data that reflects actual use cases to catch edge cases and ensure test reliability
- Clean up test data after each test to maintain isolation and prevent side effects
- For e2e tests, consider using a separate test database to avoid conflicts with development data

## Test Structure

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern in test cases:
  - **Arrange:** Set up the necessary preconditions and inputs
  - **Act:** Execute the code being tested
  - **Assert:** Verify that the outcome is as expected
- Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate the expected behavior being tested
- Group related tests together using `describe()` blocks for better organization and readability
- Avoid testing multiple behaviors in a single test case; each test should focus on one specific aspect
- Use `beforeAll` and `afterAll` for setup and teardown that applies to all tests in a suite, and `beforeEach` and `afterEach` for setup and teardown that applies to individual tests
